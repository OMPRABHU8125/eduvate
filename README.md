 In today’s fast-paced world, students and professionals alike often  struggle with organizing their studies or upskilling plans effectively.  Crafting an efficient and personalized study plan that includes key  topics, appropriate study methods, and realistic timelines is a time consuming task that requires expertise in subject matter organization and  planning. Most existing tools lack the ability to dynamically generate  study plans tailored to the user's specific needs, goals, and learning style.  • Moreover, users often need guidance on how to approach complex  topics in a structured way, and traditional methods fail to adapt to the  specific requirements of diverse subjects. There is a clear need for a  solution that automates the creation of high-quality, subject-specific  study plans while ensuring adaptability and personalization.
